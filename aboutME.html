        <p id="aboutMePara">
            I started my academic career spring of 2021 at Saint Cloud State University and was pursuing a degree in
            software engineering. After around 2 years I decided to make the transfer to NDSU and I am now currently
            pursuing a degree in computer science.
            I have around a year left of school and my future plan is to hopefully land an internship here soon and make
            my way into the industry in any respective field of it. I have looked into project management and am very
            interested into working my way into becoming a project manager.
            Among other things I have a side interest into photography and videography and have even started making it
            into an actual business so I am also pursuing that in my free time.
